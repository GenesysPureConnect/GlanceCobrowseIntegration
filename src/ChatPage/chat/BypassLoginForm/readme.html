      In this example, the information necessary to start a chat or create a callback is
      obtained from an external source, and therefore the default login page is bypassed.

      The following files are different from the default install:<br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          Customizations.js - LoginInfoSourceFactory was changed to return a new subclass of
                              ui._Internal._DefaultLoginInfoSource.
                              This subclass, customizations.CustomLoginInfoSource,
                              appears later in this file, and overrides the methods of its parent class.<br />
                              Also, a new class, customizations.CustomLifecycleEventsObserver,
                              was created.  It listens for Notifications that a chat was created, a chat
                              completed, a callback was created, or an attempt to do any of these operations
                              has failed.  It is instantiated in CustomLoginInfoSource, but could just
                              as easily be instantiated elsewhere instead.
        </li>
        <li>
          chatOrCallback.html - This is the default index.html page, renamed.  The content of the file
          has not been changed at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          index.html - This page contains a simple form into which the user may enter their username, password,
          telephone number, and callback subject.  It is meant to represent any web page, cookie, database, or
          other source for the information necessary to create a chat or callback.  For instance, a page displaying
          information about a particular product could display a "chat with a representative" link that is constructed
          using cookie data.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
